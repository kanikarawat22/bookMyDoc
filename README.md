BookMyDoc â€“ Doctor Appointment App
Tech Stack: Kotlin, Java, Android Studio, Firebase, WebRTC/Agora, Material Design, MVVM Architecture

Overview
In many rural areas, access to doctors and healthcare facilities is limited. I wanted to create a solution that could make medical consultation more accessible, even for people living far from hospitals.
BookMyDoc is an Android application that allows users to book doctor appointments, consult online via video calls, and receive real-time notifications. My focus has been on clean architecture, smooth navigation, and an intuitive user experience to ensure that the app is both reliable and easy to use.
I am actively continuing to work on this project, adding new features and improving functionality to make it even more helpful for users who need accessible healthcare solutions.
